Hello! I'm <b>Ezequiel</b>, and I'll tell you about myself:


I worked for 8 years leading teams in corporations. Until in 2017 I made an important professional decision for my career: to create a company. In the process, everything has happened to me! He reaped successes and lessons learned, he went through good times and other difficult ones, he gained a lot of experience.

This new path has forged my personality and my character; so much so that today's challenges are something everyday, and the everyday has become fascinating.

One of the most important lessons (which I would like to share with everyone) is that the comfort zone is a relatively safe place, but it is also a very small place; and the world out there is very big.

2020 was a pivotal year for many, including me. My company "survived" applying a change in strategy and a huge effort to sustain it.

Around that time, while many of us were struggling in a chaotic world, I understood that the application of technology is humanity's most powerful evolutionary tool.

So I began to study, first self-taught; then he decided to speed up that process by entering an impressive virtual academy. Platzi (the right place if you want to open doors, and above all, if you want to open your mind).

My current objective is to master a wide field of technologies that allow me to be part of an innovation team, contributing all my skills harvested over the years.

Year 2022. Currently my professional profile is a fullstack developer; and co-founder of two commercial premises, which are under my supervision.
